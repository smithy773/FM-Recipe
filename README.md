### What I learned

Learned to structure code better, keeping it easy to read and modify. Used general classes wherever possible, which made life easier when styling the website.

### Continued development

Should focus on applying proper responsive design, using JavaScript on websites, APIs.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - Helped me with the exact CSS code needed to style the page.
- [Open-Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) - I decided I was not going to use the preset selected colours and scales, just so I can get some Design practice in.
