### Built with

- Desktop-first approach to the design, but website is still responsive.

### What I learned

Learned to structure code better, keeping it easy to read and modify. Used general classes wherever possible, which made life easier when styling the website. Got good practice in responsive website design.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - Helped me with the exact CSS code needed to style the page.
- [Open-Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) - I decided I was not going to use the preset selected colours and scales, just so I can get some Design practice in.
